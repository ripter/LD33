#Make the player move.

##Problem: 
The player just hold down on the screen. They never have to move it.

##Devil: 
What if we made them lift their finger instead of moving it?

##Devil:
What if the player had lanes, and they just tapped anywhere in the lane to fire in that lane?
Then the player will be forced to lift and tap again. 

There is a lane per Egg/Tresaure/Balloon on the map.

[x] spawner supports several paths.
->[x] Mob should take waypoints in start
[ ] Add TapZones to the map.
[ ] TapZones could place the Egg/Treasure/Balloon.
[ ] Tap: TapZone to fire in that lane.
[ ] If Egg/Treaser/Balloon has been destoryed, you can no longer tap in that lane.
